# Bestseller-Book-Analysis-Amazon

The earliest highly popular books were nearly all religious, but the Bible, as a large book, remained expensive until the nineteenth century. This tended to keep the numbers printed and sold, low. Unlike today, it was important for a book to be short to be a bestseller, or it would be too expensive to reach a large audience.

A bestseller is a book or other media noted for its top selling status, with bestseller lists published by newspapers, magazines, and book store chains. Some lists are broken down into classifications and specialties (novel, nonfiction book, cookbook, etc.). An author may also be referred to as a bestseller if their work often appears in a list. Well-known bestseller lists in the U.S. are published by Publishers Weekly, USA Today, The New York Times and The Washington Post. Most of these lists track book sales from national and independent bookstores, as well as sales from major internet retailers such as Amazon.com

Into this project, I have choosen Amazon's Best Seller books data for my analysis purpose which contains data in .csv format between the year 2009-2019. I have downloaded the dataset from web Public source.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. The four types of EDA are univariate non-graphical, multivariate non- graphical, univariate graphical, and multivariate graphical.

Following things are steps performed on EDA :

-> Get maximum insights from a data set.

-> Uncover underlying structure.

-> Extract important variables from the dataset.

-> Detect outliers and anomalies(if any)

-> Test underlying assumptions.

-> Determine the optimal factor settings.

Conclusion: Fiction books are at average cheaper than non fiction books.
